## Important Information

📝 **Registration is Required**: You must register using the registration form before attending. While Zoom links are provided, registration helps us prepare resources, track attendance, and ensure you receive all necessary information.

🔐 **NRP Access in Authentik is Required**: If you are not already registered in Authentik, you will NOT be able to fully follow along with the training. The hands-on exercises require active NRP access. Please set up your NRP access and Authentik account **before the training sessions begin** to participate in all activities.

👤 **Namespace Admin Status for Intermediate Track**: If you are not a namespace admin, you will NOT be able to reproduce deploying multi-tenant JupyterHub environments within your namespace during the Intermediate Track session. The "Deploying JupyterHub" topic requires namespace admin privileges. You can still attend and learn, but hands-on practice will require admin access.

🌍 **Eligibility Requirements**: NRP access is available to users from US academic institutions or users collaborating with US institutions on joint projects. If you are from a non-US institution or industry (non-academic), please contact us to discuss your eligibility before registering.
