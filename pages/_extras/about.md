## About NRP Training

This training provides hands-on instruction for using the National Research Platform (NRP), a distributed Kubernetes cluster that spans multiple institutions and provides researchers with access to high-performance computing resources.

### Training Structure

The training is divided into two tracks:

- **Beginner Track**: Introduction to NRP, portal usage, and basic/intermediate Kubernetes concepts
- **Intermediate Track**: Advanced topics including JupyterHub, Coder, and deploying multi-tenant environments

### Training Materials
